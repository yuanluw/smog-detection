# Smog Detection

This project is a pytorch implementation of [Real-time video fire smoke detection by utilizing spatial-temporal 
ConvNet features](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11042-018-5978-5) and [A Deep Normalization and 
Convolutional Neural Network for Image Smoke Detection](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8022860), 
mainly for method comparison.
